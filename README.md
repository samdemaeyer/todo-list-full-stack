# Todo List Application

This is a **Todo List Application** that provides both a simple node API and a web client.
As this application uses [workspaces](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/workspaces/) and has been setu[p with yarn, you can simply run `yarn` on the root of the application to install all dependencies.

## API

The api is a simple `node.js` application built with [express](https://expressjs.com/) and a [swagger](https://github.com/scottie1984/swagger-ui-express).

\*_Note:_ the API does not use a DB, but stores all values in node session. In other words, when you restart the server, you also reset the data.
